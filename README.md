# Sentimental-Analysis-on financial news
The purpose of Our Project is to
Transcribe Text from video source to analyze the
events and sentiments to analyze the subjective
information in the text and then mine the opinion .
This issue is not limited to translating a source
video into a target language video since the
objective is to provide only the main idea to
transcribe text from live source and analyze the
sentiment of financial news which can further be
used to analyze the impact of these financial news
sentiments on the stock market price movement.
This study proposes the use of a gensim model
and machine learning algorithm-based classifier
to perform financial news sentiment analysis.The
training data used is labelled using sentiment
dictionary from kaggle. To determine which
machine learning algorithm-based classifier
shows better performance, some of machine
learning algorithm-based classifiers were used
and tested separately In this Project we present
possible techniques for objective, yet we focus on
Future works.
